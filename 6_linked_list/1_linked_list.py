#  what is linked list
#  linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object
#  each element (node) of a linked list contains two parts: data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence
#  linked list is a dynamic data structure which can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memory as needed
#  linked list can be used to implement other data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs
#  advantages of linked list over array
# 1. dynamic size: linked list can grow and shrink at runtime, while array has
# a fixed size which must be defined at the time of declaration
# 2. ease of insertion/deletion: linked list allows for easy insertion and deletion of
# elements without the need to shift elements as in an array
# 3. memory utilization: linked list can utilize memory more efficiently than an array, as
# it does not require contiguous memory allocation like an array
# 4. implementation of other data structures: linked list can be used to implement other data
# structures like stacks, queues, and graphs, while arrays may not be as efficient for these purposes
